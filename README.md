# GitHub Markdown Scratchpad

This is a quick side-by-side markdown editor using GitHub flavored markdown. It uses
[Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for markup generation. There are still
a handful of issues between marked and true GitHub flavored markdown but it's a
very close approximation.
