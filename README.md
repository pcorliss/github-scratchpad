Github Markdown Scratchpad
==========================

This is a quick side-by-side markdown editor using Github flavored markdown. It uses [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for markup generation. There are still a handful of issues between marked and true github flavored markdown but it's a very close approximation.
